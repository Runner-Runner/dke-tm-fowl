PROLOGUE

EXCERPT FROM ARTEMIS FOWL'S DIARY. DISK 2. ENCRYPTED.

FOR the past two years my business enterprises have thrived without parental interference. In

this time, I have sold the Pyramids to a Western businessman, forged and auctioned off the lost

diaries of Leonardo da Vinci and separated the fairy People from a large portion of their precious

gold. But my freedom to plot is almost at an end. As I write, my father lies in a hospital bed in

Helsinki, where he recovers after a two-year imprisonment by the Russian Mafiya. He is still

unconscious following his ordeal, but he will awaken soon and retake control of the Fowl

finances.

With two parents resident in Fowl Manor, it will be impossible for me to conduct my various

illegal ventures undetected. Previously this would not have been a problem as my father was a

bigger crook than me, but Mother is determined that the Fowls are going straight.

However, there is time for one last job. Something that my mother would not approve of. I

don't think the fairy folk would like it much either. So I shall not tell them.
